    <h2>JavaScript Data Types</h2>
    <p>JavaScript variables can hold many data types: numbers, strings, objects and more.</p>
    //var length = 16;                               // Number
    var lastName = "Johnson";                      // String

</html>

    <h2>JavaScript Types are Dynamic</h2>
     <p>JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types.</p>
     //var x;           // Now x is undefined
     x = 5;           // Now x is a Number
     x = "John";      // Now x is a String
</html>

    <h2>1. Strings</h2>
    <p>A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe".Strings are written with quotes. You can use single or double quotes</p>
    //Example
    var answer1 = "It's alright";             // Single quote inside double quotes
    var answer2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";    // Single quotes inside double quotes
    var answer3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';    // Double quotes inside single quotes
</html>
